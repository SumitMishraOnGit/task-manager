Ahhh got it — you wanna give me access to your code via GitHub so I can check what's wrong 🔍🔥

Here's **exactly** how to do that step-by-step:

---

## ✅ 1. Create a New GitHub Repo

1. Go to [https://github.com](https://github.com)
2. Click on ➕ `New Repository`
3. Give it a name like `task-manager`
4. Keep it **Public** (so I can see it)
5. Don't check any options like README or `.gitignore` (we'll do that locally)
6. Click **Create repository**

You'll now see a page with a bunch of git commands — keep it open.

---

## ✅ 2. Initialize Git in Your Project Folder

Open terminal (CMD or Git Bash) and run:

```bash
cd "C:\Users\amc2\Desktop\cohort\Projects\task management app"
```

Then:

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

This creates a local git repo and commits your code.

---

## ✅ 3. Connect Your Project to GitHub Repo

Copy the repo link from GitHub (should look like this):

```
https://github.com/your-username/task-manager.git
```

Now run:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/task-manager.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

Done ✅  
Now your code is live on GitHub.

---

## ✅ 4. Send Me the Link

Just send me the **GitHub repo link** here like:

```
https://github.com/your-username/task-manager
```

And I’ll check your files, folder structure, and fix anything that’s broken 🙌

Let me know when it's up or if you get stuck on any step.
